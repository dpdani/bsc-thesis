\section{Non Disclosure}
\label{sec:non-disclosure}

In this document several information internal to SpazioDati is referenced.
In order to avoid disclosing information relevant to their intellectual property, the tables referenced in this Theses have been anonymized.

In particular the names of the eleven tables referenced have been replaced with the Greek letters $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$, $\delta$, $\epsilon$, $\zeta$, $\eta$, $\theta$, $\iota$, $\kappa$, and $\lambda$.


The contents of this Theses have been reviewed by SpazioDati and they have acknowledged this document does not contain information sensitive to either their customers or their intellectual properties.


\section{Notation}

In the following chapters we'll make heavy use of standard notation for Relational Algebra, best described in \cite[Chapter 4]{dbms}.

\subsection{Non-Standard Notation}

Every table has one representation in the source database and another representation in the destination database.
To avoid ambiguity, let us introduce the following notation:

\begin{itemize}
	\item $\source{\omega}$ and $\dest{\omega}$ refer to the representation of some table $\omega$ at the source and destination databases respectively;
	\item $\source{*}$ and $\dest{*}$ refer to the representations of all tables collectively (i.e. the whole databases), at the source and destination databases respectively.
\end{itemize}
