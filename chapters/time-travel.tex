\section{Empty Validity Ranges}

When dealing with ranges, one should account for the fact that $\emptyset$ is indeed a valid range:

$$
\left[t, t\right) = \emptyset, \forall t
$$

This has the inherent meaning, in our domain, that two different records for the same table were issued at the exact same time $t$.

At first, this may seem an issue that could possibly be dismissed as very unlikely.
Nevertheless, the presence of database transactions makes the significance of this scenario become evident.
Within a transaction, different queries are evaluated and later performed as a single atomic\footnote{??? explain atomic} operation, thus resulting in several records being issued at the same instant.

using database system clock ensures positive time drift
